## Thoughts on Space

Why do we care about space?

Because it represents a great technical challenge.

I created a Satellite in a Box project to learn more about embedded software development
related to space tech. In this space, I want to explore more about space tech,
especifically how the space industry can be benefited from open-source software and
hardware.
