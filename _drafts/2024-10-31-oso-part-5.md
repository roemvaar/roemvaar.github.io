Post 5: Application Layer and Real-World Testing on OSo

Purpose: Showcase oso in action, running an application to
demonstrate its capabilities in a practical scenario. This
post will emphasize testing and fine-tuning for real-world
applications.

## Application Overview and Goals

Introduce the test application you’ve used (as per the “pp”
assignment) and how it serves as a stress test for OSo.

## Application Development and Integration

Describe how the application interacts with OSo, what tasks it
performs, and how it highlights the kernel’s features.

## Debugging and Optimizing Performance

Share debugging insights and tools used to verify real-time
performance.

Discuss any performance optimizations added as a result of
testing.

## Application Overview and Goals

Summarize key takeaways from the project.

Mention potential future improvements, ideas for further
development, or planned features.
