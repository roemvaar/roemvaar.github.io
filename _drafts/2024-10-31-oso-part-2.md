This is the second post in the "Building OSo (RTOS)" series. In the previous post I gave an introduction to RTOSs design and OSo. In this post, I will go over the details on how to boot our code on the RPi4.

Post 2: Booting the Kernel

Purpose: Walk readers through the process of getting the RTOS up and running, covering initial setup and key design choices.

Outline:

1. System Initialization

Explain how the system boots up and initializes necessary components.

Cover basic steps to set up the initial execution environment.



2. Key Components of the oso Kernel

Describe fundamental elements: task management, context switching, and interrupt handling.

Explain why each component is critical for a real-time environment.



3. Following the Kernel 1 Assignment

Reference the Kernel 1 assignment as a guiding structure.

Detail challenges faced during this phase and decisions made to overcome them.



4. Code Walkthrough and Examples

Include code snippets and explain how they fit into the kernel's architecture.

Highlight any interesting or unique design decisions in oso.
