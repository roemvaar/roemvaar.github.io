Post 3: Implementing Task Scheduling and Inter-Process Communiction (IPC)

Purpose: Dive into the details of task scheduling and IPC, the
backbone of any multitasking RTOS. This post will discuss how
OSo handles multiple tasks efficiently.

## Understanding Scheduling in RTOS

Brief overview of scheduling algorithms and why they are
crucial in real-time systems.

Explain which scheduling approach OSo uses and why.

## Designing Inter-Process Communication (IPC)

Describe IPC mechanisms used in OSo.

Discuss the challenge of implementing safe and efficient task communication.

## Kernel 2 Assignment Insights

Reference concepts and lessons from Kernel 2.

Mention any significant modifications or improvements added to OSo.

## Code Samples and Challenges

Walk through the code for scheduling and IPC, highlighting key decisions.

Explain debugging challenges, and how they were addressed.
