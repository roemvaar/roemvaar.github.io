I've completed the [Space Safety](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/DQY5IKO1U15W) course from the Technical University of Munich ðŸš€ The cybersecurity module was the most interesting for me, where I explored emerging technologies designed to protect safety critical systems both on Earth and in space.
