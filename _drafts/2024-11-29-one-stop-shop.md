# One Stop Shop - Embedded Software Engineer

This is a list of resources that I consider are "must" knowledge for
aspiring or newbies embedded software engineers, and will make your
life easier when collaborating with others:

- C Programming Language -
- C++ - Udacity C++ for Programmers
- Git - [Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) (Ch.)
- Bash
- Make

\*\* Note: This blog entry only points to resources that can
rapidly help you to grasp some concepts, but it's by no means an
in-depth guide.
