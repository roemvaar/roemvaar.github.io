Post 3: Implementing Task Scheduling and Inter-Process Communiction (IPC)

Purpose: Dive into the details of task scheduling and IPC, the
backbone of any multitasking RTOS. This post will discuss how
OSo handles multiple tasks efficiently.

## Understanding Scheduling in RTOS

Brief overview of scheduling algorithms and why they are
crucial in real-time systems.

Explain which scheduling approach OSo uses and why.

The scheduler is the subsystem that manages tasks.

## Who calls `schedule`?

There are different scenarios that can invoke the `schedule` function. The main goal of schedule is to select which task will run on the processor, it can be a new task or a `current` task can continue running on the processor.

These scenarios are:

- The `current` task calls the `task_yield` system call.
- The `current` task calls the `task_exit` system call.
- The `current` task calls `task_create` system call.
- A hardware device interrupts the processor, e.g., a timer interrupt.

## Timeline

1. Task T1 is running
2. Exception occurs, context switch from T1 to kernel
3. Kernel runs, decides which task should run next (say T2)
4. Kernel returns from exception, context switch from kernel to T2

## Scheduling - First Iteration (version 0.1):

- After kernel startup `start_kernel`, there is only one task in the system, `init_task.` During `start_kernel,` we initialize the scheduler using `sched_init`; inside this function, we need to initialize the priority queues.

- The next step is to create the `first_user_task`, which will run a demo. This is the first task that is actually runnable.

- Five priority levels are supported, from 0 to 4.

```
#define PRIORITY_LEVELS 5
#define MAX_PRIORITY 0
#define MIN_PRIORITY (PRIORITY_LEVELS - 1)
```

- Priority queue array: since each priority level will have its own queue, we need an array where each index represents a specific priority. For version 0.1, we will use a linked list-based queue supporting enqueuing and dequeuing.

![priority_queues_array](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e055cd06-cb94-4105-a86a-3527f330b21d)

- The `struct task_struct` has a `priority` field.

- When a new task is created using `task_create`, the user needs to pass
  the priority and a pointer to the function for the task. Priority needs to be greater than or equal to MAX_PRIORITY (0) and less than or equal to MIN_PRIORITY (4). Once `task_create` has initialized the `struct task_struct` corresponding to this new task, it needs to `enqueue` this task into its corresponding priority queue.

- When the scheduler needs to select the next task, it will dequeue from the highest-priority non-empty queue. When there is more than one runnable task on a priority queue, the scheduler will use the round-robin algorithm (FIFO) to schedule the next task.

- If no tasks are available to run in either ready queue, we will run the `idle_task`.

- The maximum number of tasks (MAX_TASKS) is 64. We have a fixed array of task descriptors of MAX_TASKS size. A fixed array of process stacks. Each process will have a stack.
