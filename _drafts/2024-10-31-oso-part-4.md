Post 4: Adding Memory and Resource Management

Purpose: Explore memory management and resource allocation in 
oso, providing a deep dive into managing limited resources 
effectively.

## Memory Management in RTOS

Explain why memory management is especially challenging in
embedded RTOS design.

Describe OSoâ€™s approach to memory allocation (mention your
kernel's no malloc policy).

## Implementing Efficient Resource Management

Outline how oso handles hardware resources and any critical
real-time considerations.

## Kernel 3 Assignment Reference

Discuss how the Kernel 3 assignment informed or inspired
resource management in OSo.

## Technical Walkthrough

Highlight specific code snippets dealing with memory or 
hardware management.

Share insights on the limitations and trade-offs of the chosen
approaches.
